# todo-javafx-gui

A simple to-do list application developed using JavaFX.

## About
I wanted to learn some java and used this to-do list GUI as an excuse to do so. I opted for just giving it a go over spending some time trying to understand the fundamentals of the various new aspects to this project. 
It quickly become obvious that it was very important to understand at least the concept of Model-View-Controller to avoid creating a spaghetti of code, but by this point I had gone past the point of return, so unfortunately, for the moment at least, I have decided to leave this project behind.
